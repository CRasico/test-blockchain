# Test Blockchain
Quick sample test repository to represent how a block chain is built and provide a sample console application to Demo the Blockchain for a user.

- _Note: only create a singular blockchain, for multiple "coins" there would need to be multiple chains_

# Console Application
The console application is runnable via Python 3 and a set of possible commands to help demo what is occurring

### Commands
- Transaction (T): 
    - Record a new transaction on the blockchain

- Mine (M):
    - Commit the mining operation to start mining available transactions in order to create a new block on the chain

- Print (P):
    - Print out the current state of the block chain

- Quit (Q):
    - Close the simulation
